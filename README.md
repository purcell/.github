## Open Source veteran, available for hire!

- Open Source advocate and notable author since the 1990s, e.g. I
  wrote `unittest.py` for the Python standard library around 2000
- Contributed to [many hundreds (!) of
  repositories](https://github.com/purcell?tab=repositories) in
  various languages
- Was in the top 100 most active GitHub developers worldwide for
  several years
- Largely built an [open source community
  project](https://github.com/melpa/melpa) from nothing to having
  thousands of contributors and 0.3B downloads
- Many thousands of followers here and on social media

Beyond Open Source, I'm a joyful product-and-team-first startup
veteran and founder across many industry sectors, as well as an
experienced and popular people leader, programming language nerd,
consultant and freelancer.

In recent years I've alternated between hands-on technical direction
of challenging projects, and growing/nurturing technical orgs of 60-90
engineers.

I'm **available for hire**, so feel free to [get in
touch](mailto:steve@sanityinc.com).
